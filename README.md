# Social-Media-Data-Analytics-Using-Python

In this project, Twitter and YouTube are two social media platforms explored for analysis.

Social Media Platform 1: Twitter Data Analysis

Firstly, data needs to extracted from twitter i.e. tweets in order to do some analysis. For that purpose, twitter API is used. To extract data from user, four API key's needs to be stored in a file named 'auth.k'. 
There are two files twitter_search.py and twiter_search.py to extract the data from twitter. These files shows two different approaches for the same and the authentication.
twitter_sentiment: In this file, extracted data is to be given as input in the csv format and analysis is performed on them. whether the particular tweet is positive, negative or neutral.
If one wants to directly perform sentiment analysis, result4.csv files has the data already extracted from twitter.

Social Media Platform 2: YouTube Data Analysis

Youtube_search: This file does authetication as API keys has to be fed and also search funtion.
YouTube_analysis: Here, extracted data is to given as input in the csv format. Followed by analysis.
If one wants to directly perform analysis, video_result.csv files has the data already extracted from YouTube.
